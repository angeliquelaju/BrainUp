    <h2>Benefits of Brain Games</h2>
    <p id="intro">Picture this, you have a list of things to grab from another room, but when you walk into the room, you have forgotten everything. Moments like these are prevalent; whether you are in your 20s or 80s, as memory lapses are reactions to common changes to the function and structure of the brain, this is also known as ARML, age-related memory loss. As the brain reproduces new brain cells, memory loss is common because, like muscle strength, it has to be used or not it will be lost. Though our daily lifestyle also plays a huge part in the overall state and health of the brain, by doing activities such as reading newspapers or books and learning new things like games and more, this can help improve the state of our cognitive skills. This article will go into more depth on how games specifically can help improve this.</p>
    <p id="study">According to a study done by the International Psychogeriatrics in November of 2016, brain games can help enhance thinking skills that would decline with age, such as the speed to process information, reaction time, decision making, and short-term memory.  Playing brain games such as trivia tackles the components that would help maintain the state of cognitive skills. By playing these types of games, more new things will be learned, and the more intrigued the brain is, the better information will be absorbed, which means engaging the brain to use more of the brain cells.As the brain is a muscle, exercising causes many benefits to arise. Trivia games can be very helpful to: </p>

                <p class="card-text">Cognition is “the mental process involved in gaining knowledge and comprehension”, by learning trivia questions and retaining the information, would be a good exercise to improve cognition. As it stretches the brain to evoke information, the act of trying to remember information is a form of mental stretch that is beneficial for the brain.</p>
